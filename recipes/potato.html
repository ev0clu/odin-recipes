    <h1>Melting Potatoes</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>True to their name, melting potatoes have a creamy texture that melts in your 
        mouth while on the outside, they have a crispy flavorful crust. The juxtaposition 
        of these two textures is the result of using both dry and moist heat cooking methods. 
        The potatoes are roasted in a hot oven for 30 minutes (dry heat), then broth is added 
        and they are returned to the oven to finish cooking (moist heat). The dry heat gives 
        them a crispy outer crust, while the moist heat steams and infuses them with flavor 
        (and moisture) making them extra creamy in the center</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium vegetable broth or chicken broth</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Position rack in upper third of oven; preheat to 260Â°C.</li>
        <li>Toss potatoes, butter, oil, thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper in a large bowl. 
            Arrange in a single layer in a 9-by-13-inch metal baking pan. (Do not use a 
            glass dish, which could shatter.) Roast, flipping once, until browned, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully add broth and garlic to the pan. Continue roasting until most of the broth is 
            absorbed and the potatoes are very tender, about 15 minutes more. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
