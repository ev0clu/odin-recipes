    <h1>American Goulash</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Originating in Hungary, goulash is a soup or stew that features potatoes and/or other root vegetables, 
        stew beef and plenty of paprika. It cooks slowly, allowing the beef to tenderize and rich deep flavors 
        to develop. American goulash draws inspiration from the original dish, but is less like a stew and more 
        like a one-pot meal. It features ground beef, pasta (usually macaroni) and tomatoes. Unlike Hungarian 
        goulash, American goulash cooks quickly, making it a great family-friendly option for weeknights. 
        Both types of goulash feature the addition of paprika for spice and warmth.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped onion</li>

        <li>1 (14 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can no-salt-added tomato sauce</li>
