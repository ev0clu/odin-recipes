    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We know that high amounts of added sugar can have a negative impact on blood sugar. 
        That's why we kept the brown sugar in this recipe to ⅓ cup and used bananas, cinnamon 
        and vanilla extract to sweeten these oatmeal cups. Traditional muffin recipes typically 
        have double the amount of sugar, making them more like dessert than a healthy breakfast 
        or snack option.</p>

    <p>Rolled oats are an excellent source of fiber, specifically soluble fiber, which can help 
        stabilize blood sugar levels and boost satiety. Each muffin supplies ¼ cup of rolled oats, 
        so you'll be getting 3 grams of fiber with each serving.</p>
        
    <p>The muffin tin is more than a vessel to cook these oatmeal cups, it also doubles-down as a way 
        to have individual portions at the ready. This takes the stress out of measuring, makes snack 
        time or breakfast time easy and helps you avoid over—or under—eating.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups low-fat milk</li>
        <li>2 ripe bananas, mashed (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup toasted chopped pecans</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 190°C. Coat a muffin tin with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Combine oats, milk, bananas, brown sugar, eggs, baking powder, cinnamon, vanilla and salt in a 
            large bowl. Fold in pecans. Divide the mixture among the muffin cups (about 1/3 cup each). 
            Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. </li>
        <li>Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
